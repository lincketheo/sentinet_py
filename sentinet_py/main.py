This is an example implimentation of Kermit Control Module

Kermit Control Module is an extension of the control client
The main thing to remember is to set callbacks

        Setters start kcm on a specified channel,
        if you don't set any of these, nothing will
        happen. On the other hand, the ones you set 
        open channels, so if you only want to listen / 
        publish on one channel, then only open that one 
        channel.

    can stop and start kermit.
